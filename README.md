# 9 Lives but it has a HUD
This version is based off of Vulture's 9 Lives script but has a HUD that shows Afterlife lives.

Nothing special here just wanted to adda HUD since they couldn't figure it out then, its not EXACTLY what it was wanted but its better than a repeating Println nontheless.

The HUD overlaps the Afterlife symbol and to prevent it showing the afterlife HUD it will continue to show even if the player is in Afterlife. (I guess this is good so you know whats left while in afterlife lol)

Big credits goes out to Vulture and Homura for the original code.

## Installation
Download 9lives.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder
